# RailDriver
Smart Locomotive Control script for Garry's Mod Train Build.<br><br>
## Written & developed by:
Cassandra "ZZ Cat" Robinson.<br><br>
## Warning:
RailDriver is still undergoing active development & is not yet ready for prime time release.
If you choose to use RailDriver in its current state, do so at your own risk.
Some features may be broken, bugged, untested, missing, or the script as a whole may resemble a pigeon flying by swinging its head around in circles.

Fear not! I am constantly working on this project (aside from flying my helicopters & helping out with other heli-related projects) & I have every intention of making that stubborn pigeon fly by using its wings. No matter how much the basterd wants to insist on swinging its head around in circles to fly. =^/.~=

## Description:
Do I need to categorize my readmes like this anymore? Seems a bit stuffy, to me. It's my GitHub, afterall. Anyways...

This is a little side-project of mine that I have been slowly, but surely whittling my way through over the last year & a half.

My main target for this project is for those that want to just run their trains, & have none of the fuss what normally comes with the territory of running trains in GMTB servers.

The control interface is greatly simplified, & you have everything you need to get going within minutes of showing up in your favorite GMTB server.<br><br>

## Software License:
As always, I believe in freedom & I want to pass that freedom onto you.
Which is why I am proud to license RailDriver to you under the GNU AGPL v3.
