# RailDriver

Smart Locomotive Control script for Garry's Mod Train Build.

## Written & developed by

Cassandra "ZZ Cat" Robinson.

## Warning

RailDriver is still undergoing active development & is not yet ready for prime time release.
If you choose to use RailDriver in its current state, do so at your own risk.
Some features may be broken, bugged, untested, missing, or the script as a whole may resemble a pigeon flying by swinging its head around in circles.

Fear not! I am constantly working on this project (aside from flying my helicopters & helping out with other heli-related projects) & I have every intention of making that stubborn pigeon fly by using its wings. No matter how much the basterd wants to insist on swinging its head around in circles to fly. =^/.~=

## Description

This branch contains some minor optimizations for use in a multiplayer server.
It is tested on the Flatgrass Construct & Northern Railroad server in Garry's Mod.
This branch slightly differs from Main-Trunk in the sense of how it handles errors, due to FC&N using an older version of Expression2 (before the Wire Team implemented exception handling).
FC&N is the target server for RailDriver & I have created this branch to make a version of RailDriver that is compatible with FC&N & other multiplayer servers.

Full details of RailDriver can be found in the Main-Trunk branch.

I will update this Readme as I make more commits to this branch, & I will list how different this branch of RailDriver is from the Main-Trunk. If it differs too much, I may consider making another repository for this version of RailDriver.
But, for the time being, I want to keep everything together as much as I possibly can.
