# RailDriver
Smart Locomotive Control script for Garry's Mod Train Build.<br><br>
## Written & developed by:
Cassandra "ZZ Cat" Robinson.<br><br>
## Description:
Do I need to categorize my readmes like this anymore? Seems a bit stuffy, to me. It's my GitHub, afterall. Anyways...

This is a little side-project of mine that I have been slowly, but surely whittling my way through over the last year & a half.

My main target for this project is for those that want to just run their trains, & have none of the fuss what normally comes with the territory of running trains in GMTB servers.

The control interface is greatly simplified, & you have everything you need to get going within minutes of showing up in your favorite GMTB server.<br><br>
