    # PID Controller can have several operating modes.
    # These modes can include, but aren't limited to:
    #   > Manual Mode.
    #       In this mode, all PID tunings are set extremely low, so that the control loop is only correcting for residual disturbances.
    #       Feedforward is heavily manipulated in order to provide you with a traditional locomotive engineering experience.
    #       If you're experienced with Garry's Mod Train Build & train simulators in general, use this mode.
    #   > Throttle Mode.
    #       This is similar to Manual Mode. But, with a twist.
    #       Instead of controlling torque, you're controlling how quickly/slowly the locomotive will accelerate or decelerate to your
    #       desired speed.
    #       The higher you set your throttle, the faster the locomotive will accelerate.
    #       Deceleration is controlled by operating the brake lever. Again, this is similar to traditional braking.
    #       Speed is only held when both the throttle & brake levers are in their neutral positions.
    #       I-Term Decay is heavily leveraged in this mode to prevent the locomotive from rolling backwards & winding up the control
    #       loop.
    #   > Speed Hold Mode.
    #       This mode can be thought of as Cruise Control, as it is the most simplest & most beginner/user-friendly mode.
    #       Use this mode if you're new to Garry's Mod Train Build or you just want to quickly get on the tracks & run without any
    #       hassles.
    #       Your throttle lever is controlling what speed your locomotive will travel at, instead of controlling torque or acceleration.
    #       To increase speed, simply move the throttle lever up one notch & leave it there.
    #       To decrease speed, simply move the throttle lever down one notch & leave it there.
    #       To stop completely, simply move the throttle lever to its neutral position.
    #       The Control Loop will do all of the heavy lifting for you & it will keep the locomotive locked to your desired speed,
    #       regardless of the railroad conditions.
    #       Climbing or descending hills? Not a problem!
    #       Going around corners? Not a problem!
    #       Doing a coupler approach at a slow speed? Not a problem!
    # 
    # Keep in mind that the speed settings in Speed Hold Mode are dependent on what map you're driving on.
    # In any mode, you will not be allowed to drive faster than the posted line speed limit.
    # There are legit safety checks in RailDriver that prevent you from doing this.
